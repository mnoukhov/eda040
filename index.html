<p align="justify">Our experience with this project was a difficult one because we were unsure of the general requirements and overall plan until very late into the schedule. We struggled with a few difficulties, namely with our design spec and getting the idle and movie modes to work. Several revisions of our design spec left out required details. After a couple revisions being sent back and forth to be checked off, we finally created a proper spec, which was not shown until near the project deadline. We struggled for a while to get the movie mode to switch from idle to movie because of our use of a period thread and changing the period to control the rate at which images were fetched and displayed. We also struggled with time as our group which started as four people was cut down to three, and later two people. We were able to complete most of the project, but the real camera functionality remains unimplemented due to us being only two people. If starting this project again, we would be more proactive and talkative about our communication as a team, and more interactive with the teachers so as to clarify the requirements of this assignment. Starting earlier, communicating better, and working more closely for assistance with teachers would have made this project much less stressful.</p>
